## FAQ

### Why did you do X? Why not just use Y? You should use Y. NIH NIH NIH!

Trust that I either have a good reason for what I did or have absolutely no
reason for what I did. This is a very large project in which stuff [Compilers, Depricated code, etc etc] has changed over the course of time. Insulting my thinking will only get you ignored


### Hey I'm going to go modify every file in the project, ok?

I welcome contributions, but please try to understand that I cannot accept
changes that radically alter the structure or content of the code, especially
if they are aesthetic and even more so if they are from someone who has not
contributed before. This may seem like common sense, but apparently it isn't.
If a pull request of this nature is denied that doesn't necessarily mean your
help is not wanted, just that it may need to be more carefully applied.


### (some argument over an unimportant technical choice)

In general: 'I don't care.'
That means I either really don't care and something is they way it is because
that was convienient , or that I don't care because it's not material to the goal of the project. There are a million important things that need to be done to get games running and going back and forth about unimportant orthogonal issues does not help. If you really do have a better way of doing something and can show it, do so.
